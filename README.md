## Note:

### Jack_Ketch isnot designed to be used in a corporate or illegal setting, in the event it is, I am not held responsible and all actions will fall onto the user / deployer of this software. I as the sole author, will track down anyone who uses this software or it's name in vain or for illegal purposes along with bringing to the fullest justice that any law holds.

## Description:

Jack_Ketch is a script designed to do either encryption or hashing on windows systems. The main pourpose of this script is to be used for research on Anti-viruses detection, protection measures against malware / hackers, and learn reverse engenieering. A detailed description on how Jack_Ketch works and it's different versions can be seen in each version's documentation. There are different versions based on the level of skill needed to write the file and execute correctly. The versions go from lowest to highest numbers after "Jack_Ketch", meaning version one would be "Jack_Ketch_V1", so on and so forth. Each version builds off of the last one's flaws and advancements.

## Versions:

### Version 1:

Version one is the most basic version of a XOR encryptor. It starts in the current directory it is inside of, with no root / starting directory changing. It is programed in Python and is honestly, the best first test for seeing on an Anti-virus will scan python files, which in my experience seem to bypass the most commonly used Anti-viruses. This file instead of having the contents of files be reversable, version one decides to hash the files using the MD4 algorithm. While not the most secure, MD4 is the most used hashing algorithm on windows devices due to how windows holds the passwords, for more information on windows password security and MD4 hashing, watch "The Shocking Ease of Cracking Windows 11 Passwords" by Enderman.
